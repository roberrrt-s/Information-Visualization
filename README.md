# Information-Visualization
## Idea:
- Connect to reddit account to get all followed subreddits using API
- Calculate the recommended subreddits based on amount of links from followed subreddits
- Connect topic dataset to list of subreddits
- Colorcode the recommended subreddits based on topic
- Allow the user to connect an additional reddit account to create another bubble
- Merge the two bubbles to show overlapping subreddits of interest between the two users

Extra:
- Calculate average sentiment of subreddits based on all links from followed subreddits
- Use 3d view to show sentiment?

# Weekly notes
## Week 1
- Keep readme updated
- Create issues In issues tab for gjorgi
- Reddit Data (3D?)


## Week 2
- More personalised than just basic reddit data with 3d scatterplot 
- 3D Neighbourhood/Echo chamber (Following subreddits/Rewards?)

## Week 3
- Loading animation -> Load slowly to links are created
- Starts with circle loading as user types first name (invisible search bar at start)
- Divide dataset by topic
- Use shape for subreddits you donâ€™t know topic for for example
- Use shape for followed/suggests subreddits 
- Colorcode topic
- Merge bubbles of other reddit users
- Allow for additional bubbles to be used
